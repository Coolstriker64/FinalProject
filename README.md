# FinalProject
This is the final project for my Web Design class. I have 2 objectives:
Make a resume
Program a game in which the player places ships of varrying sizes on a coordinate grid. And using a cartesian coordinate system: they must declare attacks against an opponent they can't see.
This will be done in HTML and JS.
This was made for my fall semester 2022
Oklahoma Baptist University.
