Battle Ship, but different.

1. Instead of set ships, you will have points. You can use them to make as many ships of as many sizes as you want.
2. Robot voices?
3. Real Player Mode (and AI mode?, really hope I don't need an ai)

Actual Plans:
use 2 pages, one to display the player's ships, And one for their guesses.
